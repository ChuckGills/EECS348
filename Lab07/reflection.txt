During Lab 07 I was assisted with generative ai. Due to Html 
Css Javascript, and php. I was unfamiliar with most of the topics
used in this lab. I used chat gpt to troubleshoot problems in my code
and to speed up debuging times by having it find the syntax errors. Besides Chat Gpt 
I also used the scource ode from the example as a guide to make this code. Being completely new at php
Chat gpt was able to assist part 4 greatly by explaining how php works and its basic syntaxes.
Overall I think that although I used Chat gpt that it did not deminish my work on this lab, but just was just used as a 
tool to troubleshoot and exedite problem solving
